<p>VA is an easy-to-use R program that automates the analysis of
  verbal autopsy data.  These data are widely used for estimating
  cause-specific mortality in areas without medical death
  certification.  Data on symptoms reported by caregivers along with
  the cause of death are collected from a medical facility, and the
  cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the population where
  only symptom data are available.  Current approaches analyze only
  one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or
  impossible to satisfy, and require expensive, time consuming, or
  unreliable physician reviews, expert algorithms, or parametric
  statistical models.  By generalizing current approaches to analyze
  multiple causes, <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/vamc-abs.shtml">King and Lu
  (2008)</a>  show how most of difficult assumptions
  underlying existing methods can be dropped.  These generalizations,
  which we implement here,
  also make physician review, expert algorithms, and parametric
  statistical assumptions unnecessary.  While no method of analyzing
  verbal autopsy data can give accurate estimates in all
  circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less
  expensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in
  practice.
  </p>

  <p>More generally, the software takes as input a multicategory
  variable <em>D</em>, and a set of dichotomous variables
  <em><strong>S</strong></em> (cause of Death and Symptoms,
  respectively, in verbal autopsy applications).  Both variables exist
  in one data set (a hospital in the application) but only
  <em><strong>S</strong></em> exists in the
  population of interest.  The goal of the procedure is to estimate
  the probability distribution (or histogram) of <em>D</em> in the
  population of interest.
